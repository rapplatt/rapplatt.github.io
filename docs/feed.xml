<h2 class="section-heading">What Is Optimisation?</h2>
<p/>
<blockquote class="blockquote">"The action of making the best or most effective use of a situation or resource."</blockquote>
<figcaption>— <a href="https://www.oed.com/" target="_blank">Oxford Dictionaries</a></figcaption>
<p/>
How people try to optimise their lives depends on the way they interpret that definition. (For example; is the resource to measure ‘time’ or ‘effort’?) the variations of optimisation that I tend to see happen are:
<p/>
<ul>
    <li>Complete Tasks Perfectly</li>
    <li>Only Complete Favoured Tasks</li>
    <li>Only Complete Important Tasks</li>
    <li>Complete Tasks Faster</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">Complete Tasks Perfectly</h2>
<p/>
If we decide that the resource that we should optimise is the effort that we put into doing tasks, then it follows that we must do the task perfectly on the first attempt. After all, re-doing the task would at least double the amount of effort used. Depending on how much pressure you put on yourself, this can very easily lead to perfectionism.
<p/>
As an example of perfectionism, I have a confession: I'm struggling to write this because I'm trying to determine the most optimal way to phrase every word, even when writing the first draft. When you argue that it's optimal to do a task once, the 'correct' way, it can lead to never starting on the task. Because you're now too busy figuring out what exactly the perfect way to do it is (as if that exists). I wrote this article on my phone but almost didn't start it at all. I thought the 'better' way would be to do it on my laptop so I could use a keyboard to type more comfortably. If I had given in to that line of thought, by the time I had turned on the laptop I would have decided that a different task was a more 'optimal' use of my time. (The fact that the ‘more optimal’ task is always one that requires less effort from me (like watching videos) never seems to come up consciously in my decision-making process. Weird that.)
<p/>
<h2 class="section-heading">Only Complete Favoured Tasks</h2>
<p/>
What if optimising means only focusing on the tasks and goals that make you happy? Surely one of the underlying reasons that we pursue optimisation is to increase happiness in our lives. So we ask ourselves if a task sparks joy, and only prioritise it if it does.
<p/>
The problem with this approach arises when we are weighing between a short-term and a long-term goal. If you deprioritise any tasks that are not immediately rewarding, what about the smaller tasks that build towards long-term goals? For example, writing this is difficult now, even though I know it's working towards the goal of writing a blog. Following this method, I would have already stopped writing at this point. Or to put it another way, it’s often the difference between exercising (short-term pain, long-term gain) or not exercising (short-term gain, long-term pain).
<p/>
<h2 class="section-heading">Only Complete Important Tasks</h2>
<p/>
In this approach, we are again optimising by prioritising tasks. This is where existential questions may appear:
<br/>
"What do I want to do with my life?"
<br/>
"Do I want to achieve goal x or y?"
<br/>
"Which dream job is the one true dream job?"
<p/>
Alternatively, we may not group tasks by their relation to a goal and instead look at which tasks we can remove completely. We try to use algorithms to make decisions for us or remove small daily decisions altogether by always re-wearing the same outfit (If it works for <a href="https://www.inc-aus.com/craig-bloem/this-1-unusual-habit-helped-make-mark-zuckerberg-steve-jobs-dr-dre-successful.html" target="_blank">successful people</a> it should work for us too, right?).
<p/>
Delegation of everything not deemed optimal only works if you have a lot of money to throw at the problem. Even then, I suspect it doesn't fix it 100%. (But I'm more than willing to become rich to test that theory.) Unfortunately, there are aspects of life that we cannot avoid, like death and taxes. So instead, we try to do everything in a prioritised manner, with the sinking feeling that we will never clear our to-do lists because we're only human (and cloning ourselves à la the 2018 film Replicas isn't possible yet).
<p/>
<img src="/img/posts/Replicas.jpg" alt="Poster of Replicas (2018)" style="width:100%">
<blockquote class="blockquote"style="text-align: center;">Hopefully the real-life version will have better reviews.</blockquote>
<p/>
<h2 class="section-heading">Complete Tasks Faster</h2>
<p/>
What if I want to have an amazing schedule so that I can fit in as many tasks as possible? That way, I could complete everything that I wanted to, not just the tasks at the top of my list.
<p/>
Surely one of the many calendar and organisation software things will solve my problem—oh, it could even use AI to determine the best time to do everything!
<p/>
Usually when we’re thinking this, we believe that we have been getting ‘nothing’ done - so we try to overcorrect. We schedule every second of our day to the breaking point. We know that we need breaks, but when it comes to how many and how often, we tend to underestimate. Then when it’s time to estimate the amount of time for the task itself, we again struggle to determine how much time it requires. A few people may manage to follow this new schedule for a short time, but many will build the ‘perfect’ calendar and then immediately not follow it. This can be due to many reasons, including forgetting that you have good days and bad days and planning as if every day was a good day.
<p/>
So if trying to complete tasks perfectly doesn't lead to being optimal, and being ruthless with decision-making doesn't either, and neither does trying to cram in as many tasks as efficiently as possible... then what does?
<p/>
<h2 class="section-heading">Why Do We Want To Optimise Everything?</h2>
<p/>
Instead of providing you with a non-existent magical solution, I ask you to consider the following instead: Is the dream of optimisation just another need being drilled into us by our environments?
<p/>
There are multi-billion-dollar industries that work to convince us that we are not good enough in a wide range of attributes. They have products to sell, and one way to do so is by convincing you that 1) you have a problem, and 2) this time, their product will solve your problem. Buy their self-improvement course/book/software, and all your dreams could come true. This reminds me of a story called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anekdote_zur_Senkung_der_Arbeitsmoral" target="_blank">"Anecdote Concerning the Lowering of Productivity" by Heinrich Böll</a>:
<p/>
<hr>
<br/>
<i>(As the original is in German, below is <a href="https://medium.com/life-lemons/what-you-can-learn-from-a-mexican-fisherman-a8334882204c" target="_blank">a translation.</a>)</i>
<p/>
<blockquote class="blockquote">An American investment banker was taking a much-needed vacation in a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked. The boat had several large, fresh fish in it.
<p/>
The investment banker was impressed by the quality of the fish and asked the Mexican how long it took to catch them.
<p/>
The Mexican replied, “Only a little while.”
<p/>
The banker then asked why he didn’t stay out longer and catch more fish?
<p/>
The Mexican fisherman replied he had enough to support his family’s immediate needs.
<p/>
The American then asked: “But what do you do with the rest of your time?”
<p/>
The Mexican fisherman replied, “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siesta with my wife, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos: I have a full and busy life, señor.”
<p/>
The investment banker scoffed: “I am an Ivy League MBA, and I could help you. You could spend more time fishing and with the proceeds buy a bigger boat, and with the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats until eventually, you would have a whole fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to the middleman, you could sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You could control the product, processing and distribution.”
<p/>
Then he added: “Of course, you would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City where you would run your growing enterprise.”
<p/>
The Mexican fisherman asked, “But señor, how long will this all take?”
<p/>
To which the American replied: “15–20 years.”
<p/>
“But what then?” asked the Mexican.
<p/>
The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part. When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich. You could make millions.”
<p/>
“Millions, señor? Then what?”
<p/>
To which the investment banker replied: “Then you would retire. You could move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siesta with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.”</blockquote>

I don't think we can ever be 100% optimised. There's always a way to save more time, delegate a task to others, or re-evaluate what is truly important. It could be me being cynical, but it does feel like just another way that we are being tricked into wanting more and into being unhappy with who we are. All so we'll pay for the next magic calendar software that will fix our problems this time.
<p/>
Maybe it's truly optimal to assess where you are now, and instead of trying to overhaul every aspect, simply accept it. Make changes if they seem like a good idea, but do it in moderation. Instead of going from one extreme to another, gradual changes over time have a significantly greater success rate in the long run. If anything is worth doing, it's worth doing as badly and repeatedly as needed. Above all, try not to base your entire sense of worth on being optimised. Next time you catch yourself thinking "How should I improve this?", also ask yourself, "Why do I want to improve this? This reviewing I'm doing—is this optimal?"

Do you know a "technical" person? Do they keep trying to convince you to use a password manager, but you aren't quite sure what that is? Then read on!
<p/>
<h2 class="section-heading">What is it?</h2>
<p/>
The name gives it away - it's a tool that you can use to manage your passwords, by being a secure location to store your account details.
<p/>
It may help to think of it like the contacts list on your phone. You don't remember every person's phone number, because you don't have to. You can just click the person's name, and their number is ready for you to use.
<p/>
With a password manager, you don't have to remember every password because it's stored with other details that make it easier for you to search, like the URL and your username.
<p/>
<h2 class="section-heading">Why do you need it?</h2>
<p/>
Apart from being more convenient (as described above), there are several other reasons to use a password manager - such as increased security, organization, and efficiency.
<p/>
<h4>Security</h4>
Most people are aware that using the same password on multiple sites is bad because if one site is hacked, then your accounts on other sites are at risk. (This is called a credential stuffing attack.) But most people are also human and can not remember unique passwords for every account they have. So we relax, convince ourselves it's fine, reuse the same password everywhere and put ourselves at risk.
<p/>
With a password manager, you can remove that risk without taking on the heavy mental load. Using a manager means you only have to remember one password (the master password for the manager), and then you can use unique passwords for all your accounts easily.
<p/>
Password managers can also generate new passwords for you to use, ensuring that they are stronger and more unique than "Password1" or "YourNormalPassword+1."
<p/>
The stronger the password is, the longer it will take to crack. If you want to see how long it would take to crack different passwords, check out: <a href="https://www.passwordmonster.com/" target="_blank">Password Monster</a>.
<p/>
Most password managers can also provide a review of your current accounts and passwords. With this, they give you a report of which accounts have been breached, which accounts use the same password as others, and other relevant information to let you know which ones may be at risk and need to be changed.
<p/>
They can also help protect you against phishing scams. Phishing scams are a type of attack where the scammer pretends to be the actual site you want to use. They normally work by sending you emails or texts saying you need to do something on the site (and urgently, for example, an email stating “You just sent a large amount of money to this other place” will make you panic and want to log on to cancel that), and then providing you with a link to a site which looks almost identical to the actual site to get your account details. Password managers can help because it doesn't matter how good the fake site is (and presumably it is good if you've gotten as far as trying to enter your details), the password manager won't auto-populate the details if the URL of the site is wrong.
<p/>
You can also use a password manager to securely share passwords. If you need to give your login details to someone else, rather than sending them the password in a way that could be read by others instead you can use a password manager to create a secure link to share instead. By sharing details this way you can also control other aspects such as how long they can view the password, and whether the link will only work for them or anyone with a copy of the link.
<p/>
<h4>Organization</h4>
Password managers allow you to keep all your passwords organized in one place. This means that you don't have to worry about forgetting where you stored a password or which password you used for a particular account. It’s also great for keeping track of which sites you already have an account for, so you don’t try to sign up to the same site twice.
<p/>
<h4>Efficiency</h4>
A password manager can also save you time by automatically filling in your login details for you. This can be especially helpful if you have multiple accounts to manage or if you switch between devices.
<p/>
<h2 class="section-heading">Does it mean I can be hacked once, and they get everything?</h2>
<p/>
Technically yes, but this is still a safer method than reusing passwords, and a more practical method than having you try to memorise a large number of complex passwords.
<p/>
No password storage method is without risk - reusing has a greater risk of being cracked, and remembering everything has a greater risk of you forgetting them.
<p/>
Password managers are more practical (meaning you're more likely to keep using them because they're not awful to deal with), and also they're more secure than most websites.
<p/>
There are a lot of in-depth articles about <a href="https://cybernews.com/best-password-managers/how-do-password-managers-work/" target="_blank">how password managers work</a>, but the gist is that they work in such a way that even they don't know your master password, meaning that even they can't get access to your passwords because everything is encrypted. So even if someone does get into their servers and steal your data, they still have to crack your master password first.
<p/>
You can keep everything even more secure by enabling <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/twofactor-authentication-2fa.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways-,Two%2Dfactor%20authentication%20(2FA)%20is%20a%20security%20system%20that,fingerprint%2C%20face%2C%20or%20retina." target="_blank">two-factor authentication</a> as well. Then even if they manage to get your master password, they would still be prevented access unless they also had the secondary identification required.
<p/>
What all this means is that yes if they get in they would have access to all your accounts - but they would have a much harder time getting access in the first place.
<p/>
<h2 class="section-heading">What to look for?</h2>
<p/>
<h4>Usability</h4> 
Most password managers give a free trial period, so use them to see how comfortable you are with using them. The majority work in the same way (for example with browser extensions), but you may find some make more sense to you than others. It’s worth taking the time to determine how easy it is for you to use at the start, because if some aspect of the process frustrates you then you’re more likely to stop using it and end up back at square one. Test it by seeing how easy it is to add a new password to the manager, how easy it is to use the manager to log into a website of your choice, and also how well it works across all your devices (as most password managers also have an app so you can access it via your phone as well as your desktop).
<p/>
<h4>Pricing</h4>
Most managers only cost a few dollars a month, but it’s still worth doing a comparison to ensure you’re paying an amount that you are comfortable with.
<p/>
<h4>Reputation</h4> 
When it comes to security it’s best to think about what happens ‘when’ you get breached, not ‘if’ you will. The same thought applies to password managers. See if they have a history of breaches, and if so how the company responds to them. Being breached previously is not necessarily a deal breaker, but how they respond to it may be. If they are slow to let users know about a breach (so that users can update their passwords) or try to cover it up , then that password manager is probably not the place to trust with your credentials. For example, in late 2022 LastPass had a severe data breach and mishandled it to the point that they lost a lot of peoples’ trust and there were a lot of calls for people to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2023/03/03/why-you-should-stop-using-lastpass-after-new-hack-method-update/?sh=44143d4628fc" target="_blank">move to different password managers instead</a>.
<p/>
Using a password manager is not only convenient, but it’s also essential for online security. It helps to eliminate the risk of using the same password across multiple accounts and increases the strength of passwords by generating new ones. They allow you to be more organized and efficient by keeping all passwords in one secure location and auto-filling them in when needed. While no method of password storage is completely risk-free, password managers are a practical and secure solution to the problem.

They were trading stories. Stories have been a part of human culture for thousands of years, and for all that time people have been captivated by characters who do not exist, doing daring deeds in places that never were. Stories play an important role in communication, in helping us connect with each other, and in inspiring us. Through stories, we educate and entertain. In this blog post, we will explore the impact of stories on the world.
<p/>
Let us start at the beginning, or as near to it as we can get. The world's oldest known story is believed to be the Sumerian epic poem "The Epic of Gilgamesh," and it dates back to around 2100 BC. The story follows the eponymous hero on their quest for immortality. Spoiler alert for a story over 4000 years old, but the main takeaway from the tale is about the inevitability of death. This means that for over 4000 years (at least), we have been using stories as a form of education, on all sorts of topics. We use this story to teach each other about the futility of searching for immortality. We use the story of Little Red Riding Hood to learn that strangers in the woods perhaps shouldn’t be trusted. We use tales of the Laboon, or the "wave that eats people," to know the warning signs for tsunamis. We use stories to learn about the world.
<p/>
Through stories, we can communicate and inform across generations. The story that I once heard to illustrate this point was about a volcano. One day, a little boy saw the volcano erupt. He witnessed the lava flow and the destruction of the landscape. He survived, grew up, and had a family of his own. The volcano remained dormant all the while. When he was old, he told his grandchildren about the volcano erupting. They didn’t believe him — the mountain had never changed for them, it was just a mountain. They then grew up and had their own families. If they decided one day to say, "You know, my grandfather said once that that mountain there vomited fire out of it," they would all laugh together about how silly an idea that was. Mountains are solid; they don’t spit fire. The future generations were wholly unprepared when the volcano erupted again. However, if it wasn't just a volcano, but the story of a God enraged by the people, it was more likely to be told again. A mountain may "just be a mountain," but everyone knew from their other stories that Gods were emotional and sometimes destructive beings. A tale that included warning signs of the Gods’ anger, such as the ground shaking, is much more interesting. The future generations would remember the old story, recognise the warning signs (which happened to also be the warning signs for the volcano eruption), and be more prepared.
<p/>
Neil Gaiman is one of many people who once said that stories are a way of using lies to tell the truth. It seems fitting then, that I use one of his stories next to talk about stories as inspiration. Through stories, we can do things we have never done before and experience the world in new ways. If we’re reading about how a character similar to us overcomes deadly situations, we also learn that we have the potential to overcome dangerous odds too. In Neil Gaiman’s book Coraline, the main villain is the "Other Mother". Coraline discovers throughout the book just how dangerous and scary the Other Mother can be, which means that when the Other Mother kidnaps her parents, she knows exactly how dangerous her quest to get them back is. In the real world, there is no Other Mother — it’s all a lie. But plenty of readers have used this and other tales of bravery to inspire themselves to handle the problems in their own lives. If Coraline can do it, why can’t they? Whether it’s a story of achieving your dreams or one of surviving your nightmares, reading or hearing stories of others' success shows us that success is possible.
<p/>
Of course, stories don’t only inspire, communicate, and educate. They entertain. This is equally as important as everything else covered so far, as entertainment is important to your mental health. Laughing at a story together with others allows you to form deeper bonds with each other. Stepping into the world of the story lets you forget about your own world and worries for a while. Stories following a group of friends can help with feelings of loneliness and isolation. Stories remove boredom and stimulate the mind. A ‘happily ever after’ can leave you feeling happy and satisfied. 
<p/>
The importance of stories cannot be overstated. From education and communication across generations, to inspiration and entertainment in our day-to-day lives, stories have a huge impact on our lives. Whether they were first told 4000 years ago or today, stories play a vital role in helping us understand ourselves, each other, and the wider world around us, making them an integral part of the human experience.]]></content><author><name>Rebecca Platt</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once upon a time, there was a group of people sitting around a campfire.

<p/>
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly advancing field of technology that has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, from the way we work and communicate to the way we interact with the world around us. AI systems are capable of learning, adapting, and making decisions based on data and algorithms, and can perform tasks that would be impossible or impractical for humans to do.
<p/>
One of the leading organizations in the field of AI is OpenAI, a nonprofit research institute founded by Elon Musk and other prominent figures in the technology industry. OpenAI is focused on advancing the field of AI through research and development of new algorithms, models, and technologies. The organization's mission is to ensure that AI is developed in a responsible and ethical manner, and that its benefits are widely shared and accessible.
<p/>
OpenAI is involved in a range of projects and initiatives, including development of cutting-edge AI models, collaboration with other organizations and researchers, and public education and outreach. Some of the organization's notable achievements include the development of GPT-3, the largest and most powerful language model to date, and the creation of DALL-E, an AI system that can generate images from text descriptions.
<p/>
This blog post was written using a prompt provided by OpenAI's Assistant language model. Assistant is a large language model trained by OpenAI that can generate human-like text based on a given input. This technology has many potential applications, from generating content for websites and social media to providing personalized assistance and recommendations.
<p/>
However, the use of AI to generate content raises some ethical concerns. Some people argue that using AI to write blog posts and other forms of text is a form of plagiarism, since the AI is essentially copying the work of other writers without attribution. This is a valid concern, and it is important for the creators and users of AI systems to be transparent and accountable for the content they generate.
<p/>
Another ethical concern is that using AI to write blog posts can lead to a lack of originality and creativity. AI systems are based on algorithms and data, and are not capable of the same level of creativity and originality as human writers. This can result in content that is dull and uninteresting, and that lacks the unique perspective and voice of a human writer.
<p/>
Additionally, some people argue that using AI to write blog posts could potentially harm the quality and value of content on the internet. If AI systems are able to generate high-quality content quickly and inexpensively, it could make it more difficult for human writers to compete and earn a living from their work. This could lead to a decline in the overall quality and diversity of content on the internet, and could have negative consequences for the creative and intellectual industries.
<p/>
Overall, the ethics of using AI to write blog posts is a complex and contentious issue. While AI can provide many benefits and opportunities, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and ethical concerns associated with its use. As AI continues to advance and become more widely used, it will be important to have open and thoughtful discussions about the best ways to harness its power and ensure its responsible and ethical development.
<p/>
One approach to addressing the ethical concerns of using AI to write blog posts is to develop and implement guidelines and best practices for the use of AI in content creation. This could include standards for transparency, accountability, and attribution, as well as strategies for promoting originality and creativity.
<p/>
For example, organizations and individuals using AI to generate content could be required to clearly identify and label AI-generated content, and to provide appropriate attribution to the AI systems and algorithms used. This would help to ensure that the work of AI systems is recognized and valued, and that it is not mistaken for the work of human writers.
<p/>
In addition, organizations and individuals using AI to generate content could be encouraged to develop and use AI systems that are capable of originality and creativity, rather than simply copying and regurgitating existing content. This could be done through the use of advanced AI algorithms and techniques, such as adversarial learning and generative models, that are designed to produce novel and creative outputs.
<p/>
Finally, organizations and individuals using AI to generate content could be encouraged to consider the potential impacts of AI on the creative and intellectual industries, and to take steps to ensure that human writers are not unfairly disadvantaged. This could include initiatives to support and promote human writers, such as providing education, training, and mentorship programs, and creating opportunities for human writers to collaborate with AI systems.
<p/>
By taking these and other steps, we can help to ensure that the use of AI to write blog posts is responsible and ethical, and that it promotes originality, creativity, and diversity in content on the internet.
<p/>
It is also important to note that the use of AI to write blog posts is still in its early stages, and that the technology is likely to evolve and improve over time. As AI systems become more advanced and capable, they may be able to produce even more sophisticated and original content, and may be able to work in collaboration with human writers to produce even better and more engaging blog posts.
<p/>
However, as with any technology, it is important to approach the use of AI to write blog posts with caution and caution. We should be mindful of the potential drawbacks and ethical concerns of using AI in this way, and should take steps to address these concerns in a responsible and thoughtful manner. By doing so, we can help to ensure that the use of AI to write blog posts is a positive and beneficial development for the creative and intellectual industries.
<p/>
In conclusion, the use of AI to write blog posts is a complex and contentious issue that raises a number of ethical concerns. While AI can provide many benefits and opportunities, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and ethical concerns associated with its use. To address these concerns, organizations and individuals using AI to generate content should develop and implement guidelines and best practices for the use of AI in content creation. By doing so, we can help to ensure that the use of AI to write blog posts is responsible and ethical, and that it promotes the best interests of human writers and the broader creative and intellectual industries.]]></content><author><name>Rebecca Platt</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The following blog post was written entirely by AI, using ChatGPT and the following prompt: "Write a blog post about: AI What OpenAI is specifically The fact that this post was written using this prompt and then discuss the ethics of using AI to write a blog post in general."

<p/>
<h2>What is NDC?</h2>
A technical conference - although it is now a worldwide event, NDC stands for "Norwegian Developers Conference" to highlight its origins.
<p/>
<blockquote class="blockquote">"Since its start-up in Oslo 2008, the Norwegian Developers Conference (NDC) quickly became Europe`s largest conferences for .NET & Agile open space development. However, since then, the conference has come a long way.

NDC conferences are currently running in Oslo (since 2008), London (since 2013) and Sydney (from August 2016). 
[...] Even though the majority of NDC's delegates have a .NET background, NDC are no longer solely focusing on .NET and Agile, but all technologies that are interesting for developers."</blockquote>
<figcaption>— <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ndc-conferences/"target="_blank">NDC via LinkedIn</a></figcaption>
<p>
It's easy to miss out on hearing about the newest developments in the realm of technology, so tech conferences in general are a wonderful opportunity to learn about them.
I find that it reflects a quote often attributed to William Gibson; "the future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed yet".
<p/>
The entire event was amazing, and thankfully the conference organisers made all of the talks freely accessible online.
The complete playlist of talks is available <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL03Lrmd9CiGccT0ERZ9YywROnQryo6gLG"target="_blank">here</a>:

<br/>
Richard Campbell's keynote, "The Next Decade of Software Development," was a stand-out presentation covering an overview of all the interesting ways that technology has changed over the last several decades, complete with predictions for the future for the next ten years.
<br/>
<br/>
There was a lot of common sense in this discussion, such the idea that some things will not change any time soon, like the proliferation of cloud computing, mobile technology, and the use of "catastrophic amounts of data."
<br/>
<br/>
Other things however are likely to change, like:
<ul>
    <li>The advancement of silicon chip development possibly slowing down due to reaching limits in the number of transistors that can fit within a space at an atomic level. This could lead to a shift in emphasis away from obtaining more processing power and towards optimising and refining software resource usage, similar to how software development was done when processing power was more limited. As Mark Twain once said, “History never repeats itself, but it does often rhyme.”
    <li>The use of 5G everywhere. He also provided a clear explanation of the distinction between 4G and 5G, which basically boils down to the latter's higher frequency, which enables for more data to be transmitted in each cycle but also reduces its range and weakens its penetrating power. Therefore, 5G has the capacity to carry more data but it also has increased disruption risk.
</ul>
Then there are the pandemic impacts, such as: 
<ul>
    <li>The development of the cloud has advanced significantly as a result of everyone working from home, and as a result, it may become more standardised and controlled as it develops into a utility.
    <li>There were also economic impacts, with recessions likely in many countries. Which is why it's important to know your ROI. You should understand how the business you work for makes money, and how your project relates to that. Because companies will be looking to reduce costs, and that can include reducing headcounts. It's interesting to note that since this talk was given there have been high-profile layoffs at quite a few tech companies (such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/technology/amazon-layoffs.html"target="_blank">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/09/technology/meta-layoffs-facebook.html"target="_blank">Meta</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/04/twitter-layoffs-elon-musk-revenue-drop"target="_blank">Twitter</a>).
</ul>
Finally there is the 'future tech' section, or more accurately the 'just really cool' section, covering aspects of AI (such as GitHub Copilot) and the nature of quantum computing and the problems that it can more easily solve.

</p>
<p/>
Following that, here are some other stand-out talks I liked: 
<p/>
<h3>Unleash the Power of Visual Studio Code - Aaron Powell</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">"VS Code is hot, there's no doubt about it being an utterly amazing editor, but I ask you, are you using it to its full potential? Let's go on a journey together and look to unlock the real power that you can get out of VS Code. Whether it's with shortcuts or extensions, environment standardisation and remote development, collaboration to integrations, there's so many things to uncover that can take you from a user to a pro in no time."</blockquote>

</p>


<p/>
<h3>Diamonds are forever, so are URLs - Wing Ho</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">"Imagine putting up signage saying “Puppies this way, just around the corner”. You follow that sign. Right as you turn the corner, you’re met with a 404 mole rat instead. A rush of realisation, disappointment, anger, ensures.
URLs are forever. Or so they should be. This is the experience you subject your users to, when links aren’t given the love they need. I’ll show you how you could be thinking about your app/website URLs and routes when you are crafting them, and strategies on how to migrate old URLs rather than leaving your users in disarray."</blockquote>

</p>

<p/>
<h3>Interviewing like a Boss - Kris Howard</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">"If you've been in the tech industry for any length of time, you've probably been asked to participate in interviewing. Lucky folks will receive some basic training from their employer, but most are expected to just figure it out. It can be time-consuming, nerve-wracking, and tedious. You probably don't enjoy doing it, and that can lead to bad hires and painful experiences. Kris has participated in more than 250 interviews at AWS - as both an interviewer and a hiring manager - and has finally come to embrace the process. She'll provide practical tips you can use to conduct more effective interviews, saving you time and making the whole process a lot more enjoyable."</blockquote>

</p>

<p/>
<h3>Space in the 2020's - Richard Campbell</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">"Are the 2020s the decade where regular people get to go into space? Join Richard Campbell as he assembles all the current developments in space flight to look at what the next few years could offer to a regular person on a once-in-a-lifetime trip. Will there be space hotel in orbit around the Earth? What about a resort on the Moon? Could we go further than that? And, most importantly… how much will it cost?

<h3>Building a Raspberry Pi Robot Arm with NET 6, Blazor and SignalR - Peter Gallagher</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">"In this session we'll run through everything needed to build a Robot Arm with a Raspberry Pi, .NET 6 a Blazor App and SignalR.
We'll begin by seeing how easy it is to install .NET 6.
Then we'll see how we've connected up the various components to our Raspberry Pi.
Next we'll spin up a console application to explore how we can control the GPIO on the Pi.
We'll then examine the code to start moving the connected servos for our Raspberry pi based Robot Arm.
Next we'll look at a simple Blazor and SignalR app to control our robot remotely!
Finally we'll have a look at how we can use an Oculus Quest 2 to interact with our Robot Arm in VR!
This session will appeal to all knowledge levels. A working knowledge of programming will help, but all the code will be shared on GitHub!"</blockquote>

It was not on my "to read" list, and being notoriously uneasy with horror films I had never given it a second thought.
<p/>
Then I discovered Dracula Daily.
<p/>
<h2>What is Dracula Daily?</h2>
<br/>
<a href="https://draculadaily.substack.com/" target="_blank">Dracula Daily</a> is a newsletter that emails you the entirety of Dracula in a series of emails. As Dracula is an epistolary novel, every part has a date attached to it. The newsletter follows the timeline in the novel by sending out the events that take place on each day of the story.
<p/>
For example, if the characters write about events happening on October 3rd, then you will receive an email about those events on that date.
<p/>
The timeline in Dracula runs from May 3rd until November 7th. By reading the events on the dates that they happen, you get to experience the story in 'real time'. It also means that everyone else also taking part in Dracula Daily is up to the same stage of the story - we're all reading it together as one large book club.
<p/>
That book club aspect of it is what led me to sign up back in May, and it has become a huge part of the enjoyment that I get out of reading it. Sure, I could have read Dracula in a shorter timeframe and enjoyed it - but by sticking to the email format I got (among many things) a sense of community.
<p/>
On any given day that I received a Dracula Daily email, my process was this:
<ol>
    <li>Read the email.
    <li>Check social media (such as Tumblr, Twitter, etc) to see what others have posted about the latest email.
</ol>
<p/>
With so many people reading the same part of the book as I was, there were some lively discussions online between everyone. Every email seemed to result in nuanced breakdowns from others, and perspectives that I would never have considered on my own. But for every post teaching me something new about the 1890s (like did you know the postal service at the time would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/21/business/21digi.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1267470299-TxuOOpsKkQg6AhS78K9ptg" target="_blank">deliver to houses multiple times a day</a>? You could send a letter in the morning and expect an answer that afternoon), there were also plenty of memes and fanart and creativity.
<p/>
At the time of writing this post, I am near the end of the book but have not finished it yet. Somehow, even now I still don't know how the story ends. The fact that people are avoiding posting spoilers on a book 125 years old is hilarious, but also much appreciated on my part. Instead, they wait until the emails 'catch up' to that part of the novel, and then publish their tweets and blog posts saying <i>"I've been waiting for this part to happen! Here's everything I waited to say about it."</i> It's a charming piece of consideration and really speaks to the 'community' aspect of it all.
<p/>
<h2>Thoughts on the novel itself</h2>
<br/>
When I started reading I found out very quickly that though I knew what a vampire was and understood the basics of Dracula as a character, I had no idea what happened in the actual story of Dracula. Those of you that are reading this but have not read the novel yet - did you know there's a cowboy in it? He's even a main character!
<p/>
If your knowledge of the story comes from film adaptions, you may be surprised to know that apparently most (if not all) of the adaptions are notorious for not sticking to the source material. Having not watched any of the films I cannot confirm that, but I can instead confirm that nothing I had picked up via cultural osmosis had prepared me for what happens in the book.
<p/>
<h4>The Plot</h4> 
Jonathan Harker, a recently qualified solicitor, journeys from England to Transylvania to Count Dracula's castle. Dracula is planning to move to England, and so Jonathan has been sent there to help with this. Things go rather downhill for Jonathan from there, as he is imprisoned in the castle for several months. Dracula then makes his way to England and starts causing all sorts of problems for the other main characters.
<p/>
Plot summary aside, the status of the book as a classic is well deserved. The group of main characters are all interesting individuals, and while some are eccentric none seem unrealistic. The events that happen are devastating in the best way, and the emotional impacts still resonate when reading over a century after the book was first published.
<p/>
Returning to the 'Dracula Daily' phenomenon; the email format also made the book seem more accessible. I used to read on the train travelling to and from work, but thanks to the ~world events~ of the past few years, I spend a lot more time working from home. Which is great for my commute time, but less great for my "to read" list progress. It is difficult to find time to pick up a book when it is not part of your routine. But reading an email? Sure, I have time for that! Having the book broken up into smaller more manageable chunks completely got me through the mental hurdle of finding time to read.
<p/>
I also really enjoy the fact that it has popularised reading the classics, as others wanted to recreate or extend the "Dracula Daily" experience - but since the format involves sharing the novel, everyone has been using books that are already public domain. I have already started another book thanks to this: <a href="https://carmillaweekly.substack.com" target="_blank">Carmilla by Sheridan Le Fanu</a> - which I am about halfway through.
<p/>
These are the books I signed up for that haven't started yet:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://frankweekly.substack.com" target="_blank">Frankenstein by  Mary Shelley</a> - Starting Feb 1, 2023
    <li><a href="https://lesmisletters.substack.com" target="_blank">Les Misérables by Victor Hugo</a> - Starting Jan 1, 2023
    <li><a href="https://gatsbyweekly.substack.com" target="_blank">The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald</a> - Starting 'soon'
    <li><a href="https://whaleweekly.substack.com" target="_blank">Moby Dick by Herman Melville</a> - Starting Nov 21, 2022
</ul>
<p/>
...And here are other mailing lists of books that I've heard of but didn't sign up for (because I realised I may have overdone things already):
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://carmillaquarterly.substack.com/" target="_blank">Carmilla by Sheridan Le Fanu</a> - Like Carmilla Weekly that I linked previously, but instead the book is spread over four longer emails.
    <li><a href="https://poefortnightly.substack.com/" target="_blank">Various works of Edgar Allan Poe</a> - Updated fortnightly
    <li><a href="https://thewomaninwhiteweekly.substack.com/" target="_blank">The Woman In White by Wilkie Collins</a> - Updated weekly

    <li><a href="https://nightlyknights.substack.com/" target="_blank">Nightly Knights</a> - A collection of Arthurian tales.
    <li><a href="https://romeoandjulietregular.substack.com/" target="_blank">Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare</a>
    <li><a href="https://epistulae.substack.com/" target="_blank">Letters of Cicero as translated by E. S. Shuckburgh</a>
    <li><a href="https://lettersfromwatson.substack.com/" target="_blank">Sherlock Holmes Short Stories</a> - Starting Jan 1, 2023
    <li><a href="https://divinacommedia.substack.com/" target="_blank">The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri</a> - Starting Apr 7, 2023
    <li><a href="https://dangerousliaisonsdaily.substack.com/" target="_blank">Dangerous Liaisons by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos</a>
</ul>
It was a pleasure to be a part of Dracula Daily, and I'm looking forward to participating in these upcoming 'book clubs' in the future. Come join me!

<p>This website and blog are the results of a lucky coincidence. I was browsing online thinking about blogging and saw that the domain <a href="https://rebeccaplatt.com" target="_blank">rebeccaplatt.com</a> was available. Given that many others also share my name, I thought it was a wise choice to buy it while I could.
<br><i>(Note: to any other Rebecca Platts reading this - hello!)</i></p>
<p>Since I was now in possession of this domain, it would be a waste not to use it. But how to build the site?</p>
<p>I looked into a few options for website building (like Squarespace which I have used before), but they were not <s>free</s> quite what I was looking for. 
<p>It was at this time that <a href="https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter">Heroku announced that they were no longer offering free product plans</a> This caused a lot of commotion online due to the large number of people affected. One tweet about it, in particular, stood out:

<p>Most of these options I had heard of before - but not GitHub Pages. GitHub, sure. You would be hard-pressed to find a software developer that didn’t know of GitHub. So what is the ‘Pages’ feature? 
<p><blockquote class="blockquote">GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.</blockquote>
    <figcaption>— <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages" target="_blank">About GitHub Pages</a></figcaption>
<p>For those not aware, on a ‘static’ website the page you see in your browser is the same as what is stored on the server. This is in contrast to ‘dynamic’ websites, which generate the page to show you based on real-time requests. They can be more complicated than static websites, but they do allow for more features - like personalisation. I don’t need this site to be dynamic, so I decided to try GitHub Pages. 
<p>Following the set-up guide <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/" target="_blank">here</a>, I installed Ruby and Jekyll without issue. Since it was so easy, I decided to go straight to plugging in a template that I liked the look of and winging it. 
<p>That did not work. 
<p>So instead, I read through the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/" target="_blank">Jekyll documentation</a>, and this time followed along with their tutorial. But it still wasn’t working. It seemed that no matter what I did, I kept getting the error “cannot load such file -- webrick (LoadError)”.
<p>After spending far too long on the issue, I found the answer <a href=" https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/8523" target="_blank">here</a>. 
<p>Now that things were starting to work, I decided to use a <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/previews/clean-blog-jekyll" target="_blank">prebuilt blog template</a> and customise from there. 
<h2 class="section-heading">Site Design and Customisation</h2>
<p>I had some challenges when I was customising the site - the first of which was certain <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" target="_blank">font awesome</a> icons not working. The theme I was using restricted the use of font awesome to version 4.7.0 - and I wanted to use an icon from a later version. 
<p>Then came the trouble with images. Not a technical issue this time, but an aesthetic one. I did not particularly want to plaster my face everywhere. While I could use stock images, I didn’t even know which stock images I would want. 
<p>Enter, AI Art. After all, since some articles are going to be tech-based, why not have fun and have the images used be AI generated? I tried a few different tools and the winner was <a href=" https://app.wombo.art/" target="_blank">Dream by WOMBO</a>. Almost every image on this site so far was generated using that tool, and I like the results.
<p>Then I wrote the <a href="/about" target="_blank">About</a> and <a href="/works" target="_blank">Published Works</a> pages, since having some content to work with would help with testing the rest of the website design. 
<p>It was about this time that I came across <a href="https://godly.website/" target="_blank">Godly</a>, a website full of amazing website designs. I wanted to drop everything I had done so far and start from scratch with a new fantastical design. It was difficult, but in the end, I decided to not overhaul the project and get distracted by ‘shiny things’. This site was almost done, it would be a shame to not deploy it now.
<p>I added Google Analytics and started looking at how to allow people to comment on posts. Which led to the next ‘shiny thing’ to get distracted by, <a href="https://staticman.net/docs/" target="_blank">Staticman</a>. An Open Source application that lets static websites act dynamically? Which would also allow for all comments to be stored in the same GitHub repository as the website (so I didn’t have to rely on a third party)? It sounded great. 
<p>Unfortunately, for Staticman to work you need to host an instance of it somewhere - with most tutorials recommending Heroku. Not wanting to do that, I thought about how much work did I really want to do to get comments working. I was getting into some serious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep" target="_blank">scope creep</a> and decided to scale it back a bit. 
<p>Instead of Staticman, I ended up using <a href="https://disqus.com/" target="_blank">Disqus</a>. The free version does have ads, but I have tried to make them as unobtrusive as possible. The actual process for installing Disqus was easy: 
<ol>
    <li>Sign up for an account</li>
    <li>Copy the “Universal Code” HTML snippet from their site</li>
    <li>Add the HTML to my template file (so that it would be automatically included on every blog post created)</li>
    <li>Boom. Done. </li>
</ol>
Finally, it was time to think about how to allow people to subscribe. Learning from previous mistakes of overcomplicating things, this time I went straight to using the option most recommended in my searches: <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank">MailChimp</a>. While I was adding the subscribe link to the website I realised the only information I needed to collect was the email address. Sure, I could gather names as well and personalise the emails, birthdays to send birthday messages, and any number of other pieces of data… but with how many high-profile data leaks there have been lately, I don’t need to be increasing risk. Just your email is fine for me, thanks. 
<p>With all that, the website is ready! In summary, it was built using:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">Ruby</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://disqus.com/" target="_blank">Disqus</a></li>
    <li>and <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank">MailChimp</a>.</li>
</ul>

I will keep changing things on the site, but for now, it’s in a state that is ready to deploy. So welcome to the website!
