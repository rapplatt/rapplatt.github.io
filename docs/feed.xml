<p/>
<h2>What is NDC?</h2>
A technical conference - although it is now a worldwide event, NDC stands for "Norwegian Developers Conference" to highlight its origins.
<p/>
<blockquote class="blockquote">"Since its start-up in Oslo 2008, the Norwegian Developers Conference (NDC) quickly became Europe`s largest conferences for .NET & Agile open space development. However, since then, the conference has come a long way.

NDC conferences are currently running in Oslo (since 2008), London (since 2013) and Sydney (from August 2016). 
[...] Even though the majority of NDC's delegates have a .NET background, NDC are no longer solely focusing on .NET and Agile, but all technologies that are interesting for developers."</blockquote>

<p>
It's easy to miss out on hearing about the newest developments in the realm of technology, so tech conferences in general are a wonderful opportunity to learn about them.
I find that it reflects a quote often attributed to William Gibson; "the future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed yet".
<p/>
The entire event was amazing, and thankfully the conference organisers made all of the talks freely accessible online.
The complete playlist of talks is available <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL03Lrmd9CiGccT0ERZ9YywROnQryo6gLG"target="_blank">here</a>:

</p>
<br/>
Richard Campbell's keynote, "The Next Decade of Software Development," was a stand-out presentation covering an overview of all the interesting ways that technology has changed over the last several decades, complete with predictions for the future for the next ten years.
<br/>
<br/>
There was a lot of common sense in this discussion, such the idea that some things will not change any time soon, like the proliferation of cloud computing, mobile technology, and the use of "catastrophic amounts of data."
<br/>
<br/>
Other things however are likely to change, like:
<ul>
    <li>The advancement of silicon chip development possibly slowing down due to reaching limits in the number of transistors that can fit within a space at an atomic level. This could lead to a shift in emphasis away from obtaining more processing power and towards optimising and refining software resource usage, similar to how software development was done when processing power was more limited. As Mark Twain once said, “History never repeats itself, but it does often rhyme.”
    <li>The use of 5G everywhere. He also provided a clear explanation of the distinction between 4G and 5G, which basically boils down to the latter's higher frequency, which enables for more data to be transmitted in each cycle but also reduces its range and weakens its penetrating power. Therefore, 5G has the capacity to carry more data but it also has increased disruption risk.
</ul>
Then there are the pandemic impacts, such as: 
<ul>
    <li>The development of the cloud has advanced significantly as a result of everyone working from home, and as a result, it may become more standardised and controlled as it develops into a utility.
    <li>There were also economic impacts, with recessions likely in many countries. Which is why it's important to know your ROI. You should understand how the business you work for makes money, and how your project relates to that. Because companies will be looking to reduce costs, and that can include reducing headcounts. It's interesting to note that since this talk was given there have been high-profile layoffs at quite a few tech companies (such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/technology/amazon-layoffs.html"target="_blank">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/09/technology/meta-layoffs-facebook.html"target="_blank">Meta</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/04/twitter-layoffs-elon-musk-revenue-drop"target="_blank">Twitter</a>).
</ul>
Finally there is the 'future tech' section, or more accurately the 'just really cool' section, covering aspects of AI (such as GitHub Copilot) and the nature of quantum computing and the problems that it can more easily solve.

</p>
<p/>
Following that, here are some other stand-out talks I liked: 
<p/>
<h3>Unleash the Power of Visual Studio Code - Aaron Powell</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">"VS Code is hot, there's no doubt about it being an utterly amazing editor, but I ask you, are you using it to its full potential? Let's go on a journey together and look to unlock the real power that you can get out of VS Code. Whether it's with shortcuts or extensions, environment standardisation and remote development, collaboration to integrations, there's so many things to uncover that can take you from a user to a pro in no time."</blockquote>

<p/>
<h3>Diamonds are forever, so are URLs - Wing Ho</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">"Imagine putting up signage saying “Puppies this way, just around the corner”. You follow that sign. Right as you turn the corner, you’re met with a 404 mole rat instead. A rush of realisation, disappointment, anger, ensures.
URLs are forever. Or so they should be. This is the experience you subject your users to, when links aren’t given the love they need. I’ll show you how you could be thinking about your app/website URLs and routes when you are crafting them, and strategies on how to migrate old URLs rather than leaving your users in disarray."</blockquote>

</p>

<p/>
<h3>Interviewing like a Boss - Kris Howard</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">"If you've been in the tech industry for any length of time, you've probably been asked to participate in interviewing. Lucky folks will receive some basic training from their employer, but most are expected to just figure it out. It can be time-consuming, nerve-wracking, and tedious. You probably don't enjoy doing it, and that can lead to bad hires and painful experiences. Kris has participated in more than 250 interviews at AWS - as both an interviewer and a hiring manager - and has finally come to embrace the process. She'll provide practical tips you can use to conduct more effective interviews, saving you time and making the whole process a lot more enjoyable."</blockquote>

<p/>
<h3>Space in the 2020's - Richard Campbell</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">"Are the 2020s the decade where regular people get to go into space? Join Richard Campbell as he assembles all the current developments in space flight to look at what the next few years could offer to a regular person on a once-in-a-lifetime trip. Will there be space hotel in orbit around the Earth? What about a resort on the Moon? Could we go further than that? And, most importantly… how much will it cost? The potential is huge, and the impact on mankind is hard to even imagine - maybe science fiction is coming true?"</blockquote>

<h3>Mobile App Accessibility - Allison Ravenhall</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">"Boring title, fun session: iOS and Android tech demos!
See how assistive technologies work with mobile apps. Screen readers, external keyboards, extreme text size settings, and speech interfaces.
Good, bad, and unusable experiences across a bunch of apps. Names will be named, some may be shamed. Will yours be in the mix?

<h3>Building a Raspberry Pi Robot Arm with NET 6, Blazor and SignalR - Peter Gallagher</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">"In this session we'll run through everything needed to build a Robot Arm with a Raspberry Pi, .NET 6 a Blazor App and SignalR.
We'll begin by seeing how easy it is to install .NET 6.
Then we'll see how we've connected up the various components to our Raspberry Pi.
Next we'll spin up a console application to explore how we can control the GPIO on the Pi.
We'll then examine the code to start moving the connected servos for our Raspberry pi based Robot Arm.
Next we'll look at a simple Blazor and SignalR app to control our robot remotely!
Finally we'll have a look at how we can use an Oculus Quest 2 to interact with our Robot Arm in VR!
This session will appeal to all knowledge levels. A working knowledge of programming will help, but all the code will be shared on GitHub!"</blockquote>

It was not on my "to read" list, and being notoriously uneasy with horror films I had never given it a second thought.
<p/>
Then I discovered Dracula Daily.
<p/>
<h2>What is Dracula Daily?</h2>
<br/>
<a href="https://draculadaily.substack.com/" target="_blank">Dracula Daily</a> is a newsletter that emails you the entirety of Dracula in a series of emails. As Dracula is an epistolary novel, every part has a date attached to it. The newsletter follows the timeline in the novel by sending out the events that take place on each day of the story.
<p/>
For example, if the characters write about events happening on October 3rd, then you will receive an email about those events on that date.
<p/>
The timeline in Dracula runs from May 3rd until November 7th. By reading the events on the dates that they happen, you get to experience the story in 'real time'. It also means that everyone else also taking part in Dracula Daily is up to the same stage of the story - we're all reading it together as one large book club.
<p/>
That book club aspect of it is what led me to sign up back in May, and it has become a huge part of the enjoyment that I get out of reading it. Sure, I could have read Dracula in a shorter timeframe and enjoyed it - but by sticking to the email format I got (among many things) a sense of community.
<p/>
On any given day that I received a Dracula Daily email, my process was this:
<ol>
    <li>Read the email.
    <li>Check social media (such as Tumblr, Twitter, etc) to see what others have posted about the latest email.
</ol>
<p/>
With so many people reading the same part of the book as I was, there were some lively discussions online between everyone. Every email seemed to result in nuanced breakdowns from others, and perspectives that I would never have considered on my own. But for every post teaching me something new about the 1890s (like did you know the postal service at the time would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/21/business/21digi.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1267470299-TxuOOpsKkQg6AhS78K9ptg" target="_blank">deliver to houses multiple times a day</a>? You could send a letter in the morning and expect an answer that afternoon), there were also plenty of memes and fanart and creativity.
<p/>
At the time of writing this post, I am near the end of the book but have not finished it yet. Somehow, even now I still don't know how the story ends. The fact that people are avoiding posting spoilers on a book 125 years old is hilarious, but also much appreciated on my part. Instead, they wait until the emails 'catch up' to that part of the novel, and then publish their tweets and blog posts saying <i>"I've been waiting for this part to happen! Here's everything I waited to say about it."</i> It's a charming piece of consideration and really speaks to the 'community' aspect of it all.
<p/>
<h2>Thoughts on the novel itself</h2>
<br/>
When I started reading I found out very quickly that though I knew what a vampire was and understood the basics of Dracula as a character, I had no idea what happened in the actual story of Dracula. Those of you that are reading this but have not read the novel yet - did you know there's a cowboy in it? He's even a main character!
<p/>
If your knowledge of the story comes from film adaptions, you may be surprised to know that apparently most (if not all) of the adaptions are notorious for not sticking to the source material. Having not watched any of the films I cannot confirm that, but I can instead confirm that nothing I had picked up via cultural osmosis had prepared me for what happens in the book.
<p/>
<h4>The Plot</h4> 
Jonathan Harker, a recently qualified solicitor, journeys from England to Transylvania to Count Dracula's castle. Dracula is planning to move to England, and so Jonathan has been sent there to help with this. Things go rather downhill for Jonathan from there, as he is imprisoned in the castle for several months. Dracula then makes his way to England and starts causing all sorts of problems for the other main characters.
<p/>
Plot summary aside, the status of the book as a classic is well deserved. The group of main characters are all interesting individuals, and while some are eccentric none seem unrealistic. The events that happen are devastating in the best way, and the emotional impacts still resonate when reading over a century after the book was first published.
<p/>
Returning to the 'Dracula Daily' phenomenon; the email format also made the book seem more accessible. I used to read on the train travelling to and from work, but thanks to the ~world events~ of the past few years, I spend a lot more time working from home. Which is great for my commute time, but less great for my "to read" list progress. It is difficult to find time to pick up a book when it is not part of your routine. But reading an email? Sure, I have time for that! Having the book broken up into smaller more manageable chunks completely got me through the mental hurdle of finding time to read.
<p/>
I also really enjoy the fact that it has popularised reading the classics, as others wanted to recreate or extend the "Dracula Daily" experience - but since the format involves sharing the novel, everyone has been using books that are already public domain. I have already started another book thanks to this: <a href="https://carmillaweekly.substack.com" target="_blank">Carmilla by Sheridan Le Fanu</a> - which I am about halfway through.
<p/>
These are the books I signed up for that haven't started yet:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://frankweekly.substack.com" target="_blank">Frankenstein by  Mary Shelley</a> - Starting Feb 1, 2023
    <li><a href="https://lesmisletters.substack.com" target="_blank">Les Misérables by Victor Hugo</a> - Starting Jan 1, 2023
    <li><a href="https://gatsbyweekly.substack.com" target="_blank">The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald</a> - Starting 'soon'
    <li><a href="https://whaleweekly.substack.com" target="_blank">Moby Dick by Herman Melville</a> - Starting Nov 21, 2022
</ul>
<p/>
...And here are other mailing lists of books that I've heard of but didn't sign up for (because I realised I may have overdone things already):
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://carmillaquarterly.substack.com/" target="_blank">Carmilla by Sheridan Le Fanu</a> - Like Carmilla Weekly that I linked previously, but instead the book is spread over four longer emails.
    <li><a href="https://poefortnightly.substack.com/" target="_blank">Various works of Edgar Allan Poe</a> - Updated fortnightly
    <li><a href="https://thewomaninwhiteweekly.substack.com/" target="_blank">The Woman In White by Wilkie Collins</a> - Updated weekly
    <li><a href="https://prideandprejudiceweekly.substack.com/" target="_blank">Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen</a> - Starting Mar 10, 2023
    <li><a href="https://nightlyknights.substack.com/" target="_blank">Nightly Knights</a> - A collection of Arthurian tales.
    <li><a href="https://romeoandjulietregular.substack.com/" target="_blank">Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare</a>
    <li><a href="https://epistulae.substack.com/" target="_blank">Letters of Cicero as translated by E. S. Shuckburgh</a>
    <li><a href="https://lettersfromwatson.substack.com/" target="_blank">Sherlock Holmes Short Stories</a> - Starting Jan 1, 2023
    <li><a href="https://divinacommedia.substack.com/" target="_blank">The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri</a> - Starting Apr 7, 2023
    <li><a href="https://dangerousliaisonsdaily.substack.com/" target="_blank">Dangerous Liaisons by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos</a>
</ul>
It was a pleasure to be a part of Dracula Daily, and I'm looking forward to participating in these upcoming 'book clubs' in the future. Come join me!

<p>This website and blog are the results of a lucky coincidence. I was browsing online thinking about blogging and saw that the domain <a href="https://rebeccaplatt.com" target="_blank">rebeccaplatt.com</a> was available. Given that many others also share my name, I thought it was a wise choice to buy it while I could.
<br><i>(Note: to any other Rebecca Platts reading this - hello!)</i></p>
<p>Since I was now in possession of this domain, it would be a waste not to use it. But how to build the site?</p>
<p>I looked into a few options for website building (like Squarespace which I have used before), but they were not <s>free</s> quite what I was looking for. 
<p>It was at this time that <a href="https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter">Heroku announced that they were no longer offering free product plans</a> This caused a lot of commotion online due to the large number of people affected. One tweet about it, in particular, stood out:

<p>Most of these options I had heard of before - but not GitHub Pages. GitHub, sure. You would be hard-pressed to find a software developer that didn’t know of GitHub. So what is the ‘Pages’ feature? 
<p><blockquote class="blockquote">GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.</blockquote>
    <figcaption>— <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages" target="_blank">About GitHub Pages</a></figcaption>
<p>For those not aware, on a ‘static’ website the page you see in your browser is the same as what is stored on the server. This is in contrast to ‘dynamic’ websites, which generate the page to show you based on real-time requests. They can be more complicated than static websites, but they do allow for more features - like personalisation. I don’t need this site to be dynamic, so I decided to try GitHub Pages. 
<p>Following the set-up guide <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/" target="_blank">here</a>, I installed Ruby and Jekyll without issue. Since it was so easy, I decided to go straight to plugging in a template that I liked the look of and winging it. 
<p>That did not work. 
<p>So instead, I read through the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/" target="_blank">Jekyll documentation</a>, and this time followed along with their tutorial. But it still wasn’t working. It seemed that no matter what I did, I kept getting the error “cannot load such file -- webrick (LoadError)”.
<p>After spending far too long on the issue, I found the answer <a href=" https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/8523" target="_blank">here</a>. 
<p>Now that things were starting to work, I decided to use a <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/previews/clean-blog-jekyll" target="_blank">prebuilt blog template</a> and customise from there. 
<h2 class="section-heading">Site Design and Customisation</h2>
<p>I had some challenges when I was customising the site - the first of which was certain <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" target="_blank">font awesome</a> icons not working. The theme I was using restricted the use of font awesome to version 4.7.0 - and I wanted to use an icon from a later version. 
<p>Then came the trouble with images. Not a technical issue this time, but an aesthetic one. I did not particularly want to plaster my face everywhere. While I could use stock images, I didn’t even know which stock images I would want. 
<p>Enter, AI Art. After all, since some articles are going to be tech-based, why not have fun and have the images used be AI generated? I tried a few different tools and the winner was <a href=" https://app.wombo.art/" target="_blank">Dream by WOMBO</a>. Almost every image on this site so far was generated using that tool, and I like the results.
<p>Then I wrote the <a href="/about" target="_blank">About</a> and <a href="/works" target="_blank">Published Works</a> pages, since having some content to work with would help with testing the rest of the website design. 
<p>It was about this time that I came across <a href="https://godly.website/" target="_blank">Godly</a>, a website full of amazing website designs. I wanted to drop everything I had done so far and start from scratch with a new fantastical design. It was difficult, but in the end, I decided to not overhaul the project and get distracted by ‘shiny things’. This site was almost done, it would be a shame to not deploy it now.
<p>I added Google Analytics and started looking at how to allow people to comment on posts. Which led to the next ‘shiny thing’ to get distracted by, <a href="https://staticman.net/docs/" target="_blank">Staticman</a>. An Open Source application that lets static websites act dynamically? Which would also allow for all comments to be stored in the same GitHub repository as the website (so I didn’t have to rely on a third party)? It sounded great. 
<p>Unfortunately, for Staticman to work you need to host an instance of it somewhere - with most tutorials recommending Heroku. Not wanting to do that, I thought about how much work did I really want to do to get comments working. I was getting into some serious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep" target="_blank">scope creep</a> and decided to scale it back a bit. 
<p>Instead of Staticman, I ended up using <a href="https://disqus.com/" target="_blank">Disqus</a>. The free version does have ads, but I have tried to make them as unobtrusive as possible. The actual process for installing Disqus was easy: 
<ol>
    <li>Sign up for an account</li>
    <li>Copy the “Universal Code” HTML snippet from their site</li>
    <li>Add the HTML to my template file (so that it would be automatically included on every blog post created)</li>
    <li>Boom. Done. </li>
</ol>
Finally, it was time to think about how to allow people to subscribe. Learning from previous mistakes of overcomplicating things, this time I went straight to using the option most recommended in my searches: <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank">MailChimp</a>. While I was adding the subscribe link to the website I realised the only information I needed to collect was the email address. Sure, I could gather names as well and personalise the emails, birthdays to send birthday messages, and any number of other pieces of data… but with how many high-profile data leaks there have been lately, I don’t need to be increasing risk. Just your email is fine for me, thanks. 
<p>With all that, the website is ready! In summary, it was built using:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">Ruby</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://disqus.com/" target="_blank">Disqus</a></li>
    <li>and <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank">MailChimp</a>.</li>
</ul>

I will keep changing things on the site, but for now, it’s in a state that is ready to deploy. So welcome to the website!
