<h2>"Who are you?" is a big question</h2>
<p>I'll definitely do my best to answer it though. Let's see...</p>
<blockquote>“We are the sum of our actions, and therefore our habits make all the difference.”</blockquote>

If we take what Aristole said here as true, then the easiest way to say who I am would be to list what I do - which is:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-7">
        <ul>
            <li>write software</li>
            <li>write stories</li>
            <li>write thought pieces </li>
            <li>draw</li>
            <li>play video games </li>
            <li>design <a href="https://www.sondersky.com/" target="_blank">products</a> </li>
            <li>and generally make stuff and explore things.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-5">
      <img class="img-fluid" style="width:100%" src="/img/Rebecca-Platt-profile.jpg" alt="Photo of Rebecca">
      <span class="caption text-muted">Is an About page really complete without a photo?</span>
    </div>
</div>
<p/>
Which is also what the site is about - it's a place to put the things I create, and also the things I'm interested in exploring. The content will mostly be a mix of "tech stuff" and literary analysis, though it could cover anything that I feel like writing about.
