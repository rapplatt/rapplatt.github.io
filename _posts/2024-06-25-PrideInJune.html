<p><span>It’s pride month! The time of year dedicated to celebrating the successes and raising awareness for the challenges still faced by the LGBTQ+ community. With the rise of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation sweeping the US in recent years and the seeming </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/pride-target-lgbtq-0d0ade0c3ba9766884a9ed7ad92f31fe" target="_blank">lack of brands showing solidarity</a><span> this time around, it seemed an appropriate time to look back on the history and significance of the event.</span></p><p>While LGBTQ+ people have been around for as long as people have in general, this particular month of celebration has its roots in the 1960s. If you, like myself, were not around for this decade - consider the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><span>Homosexuality was considered a mental disorder in the </span><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders" target="_blank">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a></em><span> (and was not completely removed until 1987).</span></p></li>
    <li>
        <p><span>People were also losing their jobs. For example in 1953 American </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" target="_blank">President</a><span> </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower" target="_blank">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a><span> issued </span><strong>Executive Order 10450,</strong><span> in which federal agencies were charged with reviewing their employees for anyone considered a security risk - which included anyone deemed to have a ‘sexual perversion’. They were seen as more susceptible to blackmail and were fired accordingly.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
There had been numerous movements, organisations, and protests prior, but it was the Stonewall Inn raid that sparked the gay liberation movement in the Western world. Taking place over multiple nights starting on June 28, 1969, police raided the Stonewall Inn in Manhattan. There, officers attempted to arrest any patrons dressed in a way that did not conform to the conventions of their perceived gender.</p><p>This was not an irregular event for gay bars in the city at the time. What was different this time, however, was that as the raid progressed a crowd began to form (consisting of patrons that had been released as well as passers-by). As they watched fights break out between police and those they had arrested, the crowd also grew violent as they transformed into a mob in their attempt to stop the injustice.</p>
<p>
There are plenty of articles and books that will do greater justice to explaining the events and impact of these riots than I am currently capable of doing. David Carter, author of Stonewall: The Riots that Sparked the Gay Revolution, wrote:</p><blockquote><p><em>‘Compared to these earlier events, Stonewall was of a different order for four reasons: it was the only sustained uprising, lasting six days; it was the only one that involved thousands of people; it was the only one that got much media coverage; and it was unique in engendering a new kind of militant organization (first the Gay Liberation Front and later the Gay Activists Alliance) as well as a new political ideology known as ”gay liberation.”’ - </em><a href="https://glreview.org/article/article-509/" target="_blank">What Made Stonewall Different</a></p></blockquote>
<p>
One year later, on the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots, the first Gay Pride marches in US history took place.</p><p>Over time, it extended from a day to a month-long event thanks to the collective efforts of various parts of the LGBTQ+ community. As far as I can tell, there was no particular single originator of the idea to extend the day to a month. Regardless, making the event longer enables a variety of events to take place. From parades to educational sessions, art exhibits, etc, a greater spotlight can shine on the progress made so far, sparking a wider conversation about the issues ongoing.</p>
<p>
<span>Unfortunately, while much has progressed since the original riots, there are still many inequalities that need addressing. With events organised globally (and available as virtual as well as in person), I recommend finding out about the Pride events happening near you, and how you can take part. Just remember, recognition and celebration of rights should not only be contained to a single month. There are still plenty of ways to </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2023/04/research-how-to-be-a-better-ally-to-the-lgbtq-community" target="_blank">support the community</a><span> and fight for equality, regardless of the time of year.</span></p>
